As far as the source code goes, it will be attached to this email, as well as my
unreleased "pro" version. This version was not release due to the in-ability to
test it on a fully working robot. The pro version added the ability to use the
accelerometer and camera from the robot. The code was tested quite a bit, with
both the camera and accelerometer, but in the end I never released it. It SHOULD
work, but I never got to the point where I KNOW it works.
